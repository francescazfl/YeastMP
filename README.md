# YeastMP
Yeast-Based Microplastics Sensing and Remediation Modeling: To detect and combat plastic pollution, especially from widespread fragments that are small enough to be ingested, I proposed a yeast-based solution. In the device I designed, there are genetically engineered yeast cells, which are able to sense, classify and quantify microplastics (MPs) in water with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), a dCas9-based toggle system and a focus on one MP, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). An enzyme, PETase, has been found to break PET down to mainly mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) as well as some amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). *Fall 2018 by FZL
